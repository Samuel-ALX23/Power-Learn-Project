This repository is dedicated to my journey through the Power Learn Project scholarship program for the July 2025 cohort. It serves as a central hub for all my projects and assignment submissions related to the course curriculum.

Here you will find:
* **Course Projects:** All coding projects, from foundational exercises to more complex, multi-module applications, built throughout the program.
* **Assignment Submissions:** A record of all completed assignments, including code, documentation, and any other required deliverables.
* **Learning Progress:** A chronological log of my progress, showcasing the skills and concepts I've mastered.

This repository demonstrates my practical application of the skills learned in the Power Learn Project, including Python, Data Engineering, Web Development. It is a reflection of my commitment to becoming a proficient software developer.
